<h1>PhD</h1>

I am currently based in the Computer Science Department at University College London (UCL) under the supervision of Dr. Lewis Griffin. 
I share my time between theoretical and applied work in Machine Learning:
<ul>
 	<li>I am interested in the limits of Deep Learning as a model for Human Vision. 
	In this context, I recently focused my attention on the counter-intuitive <em>Adversarial Example phenomenon</em>.</li>
 	<li>After a 6-month internship at <a href="https://www.iproov.com/">iProov</a> (a London-based startup offering online authentication services) in 2015, 
	I now work closely with <a href="http://compass.cs.ucl.ac.uk/">COMPASS</a> on developing state-of-the-art methods for Security Science.</li>
</ul>

<h1>CoMPLEX</h1>
<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/complex/">CoMPLEX</a> is the <em>Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology</em> at UCL. 
During the the M.Res. year (2013/2014), I joined research teams in three different laboratories for 6-week long "Case-Projects".

<h1>Goldsmiths</h1>
In 2011/2012, I followed the M.Sc. in <em>Cognitive Computing</em> at Goldsmiths, University of London, where I developed an interest in the emergent dynamics of swarm behaviour.

<h1>Monash</h1>
While pursuing a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.supmeca.fr/">Supm√©ca Paris</a> (France), I had the opportunity at the end of 2010 to undertake a 4-month internship at Monash 
University (Australia) in the <a href="http://ldi.monash.edu/">Laboratory for Dynamic Imaging</a>.
